# WebDesign for Beginners University of Moratuwa

I learned how to develop a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript through the Web Design of Beginners Certificate course conducted online by the University of Moratuwa.

As the last project of that course, I created a Responsive Website for a Video Streaming platform called VidMax.
